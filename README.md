Java Class describing a surface in 3d by listing individual nodes and their normal vectors relative to the surface.

The surface can then be illuminated by (parallel) lights from different directions and drawn via parallel projection.

Shadow Casting works fine, Future improvements might involve making the generating of new shapes easier as well as adding some texture to the surface.
